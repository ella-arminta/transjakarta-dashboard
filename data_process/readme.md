Please, read this before before you continue to read / run the Jupyter Notebook file.

This notebook is created as a portfolio project for me to participate in Data Science course in Purwadhika. The notebook is about doing dataset dummy creation. So this is my portfolio to work on my learning journey towards data science. This dataset might have some flaws, but i tried my best. ;D

The master datas are sourced from: https://ppid.transjakarta.co.id/pusat-data/data-terbuka/transjakarta-gtfs-feed The data was generated using **Python using Faker and Random** based on master datas. The source might be updated from time to time and the dataset might not represent the latest version from the source.

I'm not using all master data to create my dataset, only: routes.txt for route master, trips.txt for trip id and direction, stop_times.txt for stop id and sequence, stops.txt for stop name and coordinate, fare_rules.txt for mapping fare id with route, and fare_attributes.txt for mapping prices with fare id based on route.

You can also download this data from my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dikisahkan/transjakarta-transportation-transaction)

**Context:** Transjakarta is public transportation company from Indonesia, based in Jakarta. The transportation modes are big bus (BRT), medium and big bus (non-BRT), mini bus (Mikrotrans). The mechanism in Transjakarta is to Tap-In and Tap-Out using payment card as your tickets.

**Content:** Basically this data is simulation for Transaction data in Transjakarta. It does not represent the real data / structure used in Transjakarta

**Inspiration:** Transjakarta is growing as public transportation company. But none have shared data for the transaction analysis. We can analyze which route are busy and not. Which route is heavy with traffic jam or not. And other dimension provided you can analyze.
